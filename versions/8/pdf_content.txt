are
 
expected
 
to
 
introduce
 
a

so
 
that
 
the
 
user
 
can
 
preview
 
all
 
of
 
them
 
 
 
$Step-Summary
 
-
 
Has
 
a
 
collapsable
 
button,
 
similar
 
to
 
the
 
$Left-Navigation
,
 
except
 
that
 
it
 
collapses
 
vertically,
 
closer
 
to
 
the
 
$Header-Instructions
 
so
 
that
 
the
 
$Step-Details-Template
 
panels
 
can
 
occupy
 
a
 
longer
 
portion
 
of
 
the
 
screen.
 
 
-
 
Each
 
step
 
of
 
this
 
should
 
correspond
 
to
 
exactly
 
one
 
$Step-Details
 
from
 
the
 
selected
 
page.
 
 
-
 
Each
 
step
 
should
 
have
 
a
 
notion
 
of
 
completeness
 
that
 
will
 
be
 
represented
 
with
 
an
 
icon
 
before
 
the
 
step’s

The
 
icons
 
can
 
be
 
‘Not
 
Started’,
 
‘In-Progress’,
 
‘Completed’
 
and
 
will
 
dynamically
 
updates
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
actions
 
the
 
user
 
takes
 
in
 
the
 
$Step-Details

to
 
the

the

A

that
 
at

are
 
collapsed,
 
but
 
the
 
user
 
can
 
expand
 
to
 
read
 
detailed
 
instructions
 
on
 
each
 
step
 
-
 
The
 
panel
 
should
 
always
 
display
 
the

title
 
and

,
 
even
 
when

-
 
The

when

should
 
have
 
the
 
vertical
 
size
 
of
 
the
 
$Top-Navigation-Area
 
-
 
The
 
panel
 
when
 
expanded
 
should
 
have
 
a
 
triple
 
the
 
size
 
of
 
the
 
$Top-Navigation-Area
 
with
 
⅓
 
reserved
 
for
 
the

so
 
when
 
the

expands
 
and
 
collapses
 
the

is
 
smooth

The
